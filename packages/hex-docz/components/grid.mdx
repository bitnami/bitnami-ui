# Grid

This component is the generic wrapper for any content in the project. It encapsulates its children
into a container that delimits the maximum width. You can combine it with `Row` and `Col` components
to get all the features of a grid system.

## React

### Example

<Playground>
  <Grid size="small">
    Hello from HEx
  </Grid>
</Playground>

### PropTypes

<PropsTable of={Grid} />

## Vanilla

These modifiers are mapped directly from CSS classes you can use directly in your HTML code:

### Example

<Playground>
  <div class="container container-small">
    Hello from HEx
  </div>
</Playground>

## Accesibility

Since this is a generic component, it doesn't have any particular accessibility requirement.
It's just for presentation.
