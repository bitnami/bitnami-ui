# Blockquote

Blockquote is a component to display a cite or any other text you want to highlight. This component
is useful to highlight a special text in a page.

Check the next sections to find some customizations.

### Example

<Playground>
  <Blockquote color="accent" cite="https://twitter.com/ericabrescia/status/803775698297036801">
    Great day at my first Linux Foundation board meeting, but looking forward to seeing
    everyone at #awsreinvent. On my way!
    <br />
    See you there!

  <Blockquote outstanding cite="https://twitter.com/ericabrescia/status/803775698297036801">
    Great day at my first Linux Foundation board meeting, but looking forward to seeing
    everyone later. On my way!
    <br />
    See you there!

## Accesibility

It's important to identify properly the source of the quote and the author of it:

* Set the source of teh quote using the `cite` property of the component
* Add an anchor with a proper link to the author profile. Add the `rel="author"` property to that anchor
