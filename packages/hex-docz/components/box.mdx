# Box

Box is the most basic component of the library. It acts as a simple `div` but includes all the
helpers in the React component.

## React

### Example

<Playground>
  <Box marginV="big" paddingH="huge" color="light" background="accent" shadow={1}>
    Hello from HEx
  </Box>
</Playground>

### PropTypes

<PropsTable of={Box} />

## Vanilla

These modifiers are mapped directly from CSS classes you can use directly in your HTML code:

### Example

<Playground>
  <div class="margin-t-big bg-brand padding-normal">
    Hello from HEx
  </div>
</Playground>

## Accesibility

Since this is a generic component, it doesn't have any particular accessibility requirement.
It's just for presentation.
