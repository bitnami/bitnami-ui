# Box

Box is the most basic component of the library. It acts as a simple `div` but includes all the
helpers in the React component.

## Example

<Playground>
  <Box marginVertical="big" paddingHorizontal="huge" color="light" background="action">
    Hello from HEx
  </Box>
</Playground>

## React

<PropsTable of={PureBox} />

## Accesibilty

Since this is a generic component, it doesn't have any particular accessibility requirement.
It's just for presentation.
