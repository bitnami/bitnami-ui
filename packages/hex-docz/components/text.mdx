# Text

Text is a basic component for styling the inner text. It includes different helpers to modify the
font size, style, weight and color.

## React

### Example

<Playground>
  <Text fontSize="big">
    Hello from HEx
  </Text>
</Playground>

### PropsTable

<PropsTable of={Text} />

## Vanilla

Text modifiers are a bunch of CSS classes that modifies the behaviour of the text
in the inner elements.

### Example

<Playground>
  <p class="type-big type-color-accent">
    Hello from HEx
  </p>
</Playground>

## Accesibility

Since this is a generic component, it doesn't have any particular accessibility requirement.
It's just for presentation.
