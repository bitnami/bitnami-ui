# Column

`Column` components are used inside the [`Row`](/components/row) of a grid. It can span its width to the
number of columns to assign to it but it can be eventually collapsed by the parent `Row`. This component
also accepts an `align` parameter to change the centering behaviour of a column.

By default, the HEx grid is divided in 12 columns.

## React

### Example

<Playground>
  <Grid size="small">
    <div class="row collapse-b-tablet">
      <Column span={6}>
        Hello from HEx
      </Column>
      <Column span={6}>
        Hello from HEx
      </Column>
    </div>
  </Grid>
</Playground>

### PropTypes

<PropsTable of={Column} />

## Vanilla

These modifiers are mapped directly from CSS classes you can use directly in your HTML code:

### Example

<Playground>
  <div class="container container-small">
    <div class="row collapse-b-tablet">
      <div class="col-6">
        Hello from HEx
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        Hello from HEx
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</Playground>

## Accesibility

Since this is a generic component, it doesn't have any particular accessibility requirement.
It's just for presentation.
