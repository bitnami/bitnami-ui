# Link

`Link` is a helper component that ensure you set the proper HTML attributes to the anchors. For example,
we must use `noopener` to security issues with external links.

## React

### Example

<Playground>
  <Link href="https://design.bitnami.com" external>
    HEx Design System
  </Link>
</Playground>

### PropTypes

<PropsTable of={Link} />

## Vanilla

These modifiers are mapped directly from anchor (`a`) attributes you can use directly in your HTML code:

### Example

<Playground>
  <a href="https://design.bitnami.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    HEx Design System
  </a>
</Playground>

## Accesibility

Links are the way people navigate through websites. It's important to keep them clear, so people know where
will be redirected. These are some rules to make your links more accessible:

* Don't use icons/images without `alt` inside an anchor
* Keep the text of the link concise
* Don't use non-ASCII characters in links
* Avoid the usage of emojis
